# diagnosis-from-3d-brain-mri

In this project, we built a multi-class neural network to automatically segment tumor regions from brain Magnetic Resonance Imagery scans, in order to identify 3 different types of abnormalities: edemas, non-enhancing tumors, and enhancing tumors.

The notebook covers in particular the following aspects:
- 3D Brain MRI data exploration
- Data preparation techniques for MRI datasets
- Data augmentation
- Metrics and loss function for segmentation
- Building the U-net
- Training the model and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluating segmentation performance

NB: this work is still in progress. Regular updates will be made to the notebook.
